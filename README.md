## Dataset Overview
Our dataset was collected manually and consists of videos capturing specific actions, such as deadlifts, lunges, and squats. Each video contains 4â€“6 repetitions of the action. To facilitate the evaluation of individual repetitions, we preprocessed the dataset by splitting each video into five sub-videos, corresponding to the average number of repetitions. Each sub-video was further divided into 16 frames to standardize the input.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into three folders:
- `Deadlift_Frames`
- `Lunges_Frames`
- `Squat_Frames`

The frames within each folder follow a consistent naming convention:  
`{video_idx}_idx_{exercise_idx}_{frame_idx}`  
- **`video_idx`**: Index of the original video (odd numbers for the frontal view, even numbers for the lateral view).  
- **`exercise_idx`**: The specific exercise type.  
- **`frame_idx`**: The frame number within the sub-video.
