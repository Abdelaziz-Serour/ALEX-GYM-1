    "- **Description**: This function evaluates both the classification and rating prediction models on the provided dataset. It computes the average evaluation loss, classification accuracy, and rating accuracies for different actions (deadlift, squat, lunges) using a given `DataLoader` and loss functions.\n",

    "  - `classification_model (torch.nn.Module)`: The classification model (e.g., `Dual_Combined_Model`).\n",

    "  4. **Compute Average Metrics**: Computes the average classification loss, overall classification accuracy, and rating accuracy for each action.\n",
